# Factorio Screenshot Mod

Place control.lau, info.json and data.lua in \factorio\mods\screenshot_0.1.1

./factorio --load-game \<name of game\>.zip

Game save must have been loaded before

Mod will take a tiled screenshot at the dimensions specified in the top of control.lua on game launch

Use combine_images.sh to render the final output

I'm using Factorio version 13.20
